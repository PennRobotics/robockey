__Details__  
The Robockey robots for the code in this repository use a differential drive and several sensors to perform autonomous tasks specific to the game of hockey. Gameplay occurs on a slick surface---a rounded rectangle with dimensions approximately four feet by eight feet. M2 (MAEVARM) microcontrollers---created by Dr. Jonathan Fiene---are used to input sensor data, perform calculations, and control each motor driver.
